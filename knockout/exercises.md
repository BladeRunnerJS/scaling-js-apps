# Knockout Exercise (15 mins)

The [KnockoutJS website](http://knockoutjs.com/) is the best learning resource. We suggest doing the
following two tutorials:

1. [Basic Introduction](http://learn.knockoutjs.com/#/?tutorial=intro)
2. [Working with Lists & Collections](http://learn.knockoutjs.com/#/?tutorial=collections)

Once you've completed these you'll have enough knowledge for the rest of this
workshop.

**If you get stuck at any point - during this exercies or any future ones - please
just ask for help. It's what we're here for.**

## As you work...

We'll be heading around and getting your GitHub usernames so we can give you
permission to the repository for the application you'll be working on.
