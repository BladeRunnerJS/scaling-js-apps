# Knockout

**The focus of this workshop isn't KnockoutJS**. However, being able to test the UI
without poking the [DOM (Document Object Model)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM)
is a key in building a large scale front-end app. So, we need to use a solution
that helps this.

Knockout is an [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) solution
where the View Model is a logical representation of the view. We'll talk about
why that's important when we get to Feature testing.
