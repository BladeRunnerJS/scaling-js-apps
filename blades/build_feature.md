# ModularApps Features/Blades

**Note: At Caplin we use the term Blade to represent an application feature. This is
because it represents a full slice of application functionality containing everything
required to fullfil a business requirements. So, "Feature" and "Blade" are generally
inter-changable.**

Within your company decide which team is going to build a feature and each team
should do one of the following exercises:

* [Input](input_blade.html) for entering text and sending a message
* [Messages](messages_blade.html) display showing all the previous chat messages
* [User Card](usercard_blade.html) display more information about a user
