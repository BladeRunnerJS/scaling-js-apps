# Heads Up!

BladeRunnerJS is a newly open sourced toolkit. We chose to use it for this workshop
as it's a toolkit that we know well and has the concepts that will result in a
maintainable and extensible front-end web app built-in. It will be possible to achieve
similar results using other tooling that has been configured and set up accordingly -
but we haven't found anything that delivers the same results out-of-the-box,
*or we'd be using it*.

BladeRunnerJS is in beta. It therefore isn't perfect so you may come across bugs
and there may be a few things that aren't as we'd like them to be. We're **software people**
who love to live on the bleeding edge, right? It's one of the things that makes
software development exciting!

As a heads-up, you should be aware of the following:

* The **directory structure** is too deep and complicated. We want to change this.
* The **testing experience** is sub-optimal. So, we're not going to focus too heavily on tests.
* The Workbench code should be simplified to make it easier to **take advantage of Workbenches**.

If you come across a problem then please *shout at us*. We're here to help. If you
can't grab us, or would like to check if it's a known issue or a listed *Gotcha* then
check out the [FAQ & Gotcha reference](/reference/faq_gotchas.html).

**Let's get developing!**
