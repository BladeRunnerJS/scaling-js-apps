# What are Features/Blades?

*At Caplin we use the term Blade to represent an application feature. This is
because it represents a full slice of application functionality containing everything
required to fullfil a business requirements. So, "Feature" and "Blade" are generally
inter-changable.*

## Concepts & Demo

* Scaffolding
* Building a feature in isolation
  * All assets are co-located
  * Tests reside with the feature
* Workbenches
* Asset dependency analysis
* A note on CSS

**TODO: show app split into blades**
