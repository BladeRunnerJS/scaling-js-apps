# That's a Wrap!

**Congratulations!** You've completed the *How to Build Front-End Web Apps that Scale* workshop.

Hopefully you've built your own fully functional ModularApp. But you can also find the completed application source code in [BladeRunnerJS/modularapp](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/modularapp) on GitHub.

If you want to provide feedback please drop [bladerunnerjs@caplin.com](mailto:bladerunnerjs@caplin.com) an email or speak to the workshop instructor. You'll also likely get an email requesting feedback in the future.

For more information on BladeRunnerJS - including documentation and example applications - checkout the [BladeRunnerJS website](http://bladerunnerjs.org).
