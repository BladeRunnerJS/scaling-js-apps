# Overview

The purpose of this workshop is to learn how to build a maintainable and extensible
front-end applications that offer highly complex functionality, consist of
thousands of assets and thousands of lines of JavaScript.

The principles and practices have developed over a number of years at [Caplin Systems](http://www.caplin.com)
as part of building and maintaining [Caplin Trader](http://caplin.com/caplin-trader)-based
applications. In addition, Caplin's customers also use the same principles, practices
and tooling to themselves build large and highly functional front-end applications.
