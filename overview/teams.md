# Companies

Each company should have a maximum of a team per feature e.g. if we have 3 features
there should be 3 teams.

# Teams

Each team should ideally be of 2 - for pair programming. Not everybody likes
pair programming. However, we're going to be learning a lot in a short space of
time and two heads will be better than one at problem solving.

*Come up with a team name and add your team name and GitHub usernames to the
Google Doc*.
