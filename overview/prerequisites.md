# Prerequisites

Before getting started you need the following in place:

1. Laptop
2. A git client
3. A GitHub account
4. Java 7 or 8 installed
5. The [latest BladeRunnerJS release](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/releases)

## Get the Code!

### If the Wifi is behaving

 - Clone the App starting point from `https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/futurejs-modularapp-<Company Name>` into `BladeRunnerJS/apps`
   - To reduce the load on the wifi the app can be cloned from the USB stick
   - If you cloned from the USB stick you will need to reconfigure your remote repo; `git remote remove origin` and `git remote add origin https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/futurejs-modularapp-<Company Name>`

### No Wifi :-(

Speak to the person running the workshop. They'll have the getting started files. However, this will make working in teams particularly difficult.

## Next - Heads up!
