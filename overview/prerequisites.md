# Prerequisites

Before getting started you need the following in place:

1. Laptop
2. A git client
3. A GitHub account
4. Java 7 or 8 installed
5. The latest BladeRunnerJS release
 - We'll be using a 'develop' release as it has several useful performance and bug fixes
 - The release can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/s/iv3fv0be3w8cpt5/BladeRunnerJS-v0.7-108-g0b13594.zip or copied from a USB stick to reduce the load on the wifi

## Get the Code!

### If the Wifi is behaving

 - Clone the App starting point from `https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/futurejs-modularapp-<Company Name>` into `BladeRunnerJS/apps`
   - To reduce the load on the wifi the app can be cloned from the USB stick
   - If you cloned from the USB stick you will need to reconfigure your remote repo; `git remote remove origin` and `git remote add origin https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/futurejs-modularapp-<Company Name>`

### No Wifi :-(

 - Clone the App from the USB stick into `BladeRunnerJS/apps`
 - The USB stick can then be used as a replacement for GitHub to share code with the rest of your company (e.g. `git push origin master` will push to the USB stick)

## Before we begin

* Who has experience of [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/)?
