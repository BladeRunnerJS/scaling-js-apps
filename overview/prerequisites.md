# Prerequisites

Before getting started you need the following in place:

1. Laptop
2. A git client
3. A GitHub account
4. Java 7 or 8 installed
5. The [latest BladeRunnerJS release](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/releases)

## Get the Code!

### If the Wifi is behaving

 - Clone the App starting point from `https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/<app-name>` (**see Share Google Doc for full URL**) into `BladeRunnerJS/apps`

### No Wifi :-(

Speak to the person running the workshop. They'll have the getting started files. However, this will make working in teams particularly difficult.

## Next - Heads up!
