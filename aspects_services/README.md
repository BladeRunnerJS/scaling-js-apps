# Apps & Aspects (Again)

We've already seen how to compose Blades into our Aspect. And we don't need to
do this again. But, we do need to check that our updated Blades work within
our Aspect.

## Exercise

All teams should now run the Aspect and see if the application works. If it
doesn't then the point of this exercise is to work out why and fix any problems.
